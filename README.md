# Airbnb-NYC

## Installation
The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
The data set, containing information about Airbnb descriptions and ratings in New York City, was imported from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) on 2021-05-02. Using this data set, I tried to answer the most important question of a potential host: what should a host do to obtain high ratings from the customers? 

More specifically, I tried to answer the following three questions:
1. Which neighborhood has a high rating in 'location'?
2. Will the ratings be higher, if the host lives in the same neighborhood where the listing is?
3. Overall, what is most important if a host wants to achieve a high overall rating?

## File Descriptions
* one notebook, containing all the codes and explanatory markdown cells,
* one csv file, containing all data needed

## Results
The main findings of the code are summarized at this post.

## Licensing
As mentioned above, the data is from Inside Airbnb which is available under a Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0) "Public Domain Dedication" license. Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you like!
